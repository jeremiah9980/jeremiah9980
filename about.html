      <p class="meta">
        I’m a senior infrastructure and platform engineer with over two decades
        of hands-on experience designing, automating, and operating
        enterprise-scale systems across on-prem, cloud, and hybrid environments.

      <!-- BACKGROUND -->
      <h3>Professional Background</h3>
      <p>
        My career spans the full infrastructure lifecycle — from traditional
        data center environments and virtualization platforms, through modern
        cloud-native architectures, Kubernetes platforms, CI/CD systems, and
        Site Reliability Engineering practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in building platforms that are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reliable by design, not by heroics</li>
        <li>Automated, observable, and operable at scale</li>
        <li>Secure, segmented, and auditable</li>
        <li>Aligned with real business and engineering workflows</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I’m most effective at the intersection of architecture, automation,
        and operations — where systems must not only work, but continue to
        work under growth, change, and failure.
      </p>

      <!-- COSMICGEN -->
      <h3>CosmicGen — GPU & Infrastructure Resource Provider</h3>
      <p>
        I am actively involved with <strong>CosmicGen</strong>, a startup focused
        on providing scalable GPU and infrastructure resources for AI, ML,
        and high-performance workloads.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work with CosmicGen centers on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designing secure, segmented network infrastructure for GPU clusters</li>
        <li>Building automation-first provisioning and lifecycle management</li>
        <li>Supporting MSP-style operational models for shared infrastructure</li>
        <li>Balancing performance, cost efficiency, and operational safety</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This work reflects real-world challenges around capacity planning,
        multi-tenant isolation, reliability, and rapid iteration in
        early-stage environments.

      <!-- CARGILL CONSULTING -->
      <h3>Cargill Consulting</h3>
      <p>
        Through <strong>Cargill Consulting</strong>, I provide advisory and
        hands-on engineering services focused on infrastructure modernization,
        platform engineering, and operational maturity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical engagements include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Infrastructure and cloud migration planning</li>
        <li>Platform and Kubernetes architecture reviews</li>
        <li>CI/CD and automation strategy</li>
        <li>Observability, reliability, and incident response practices</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The goal is always the same: reduce operational risk, improve delivery
        velocity, and leave teams with systems they can confidently own and
        evolve.
      </p>

      <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
      <h3>Engineering Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        I believe strong platforms are built on clarity — clear ownership,
        clear interfaces, and clear operational expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I value:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Designing for failure and recovery, not just success</li>
        <li>Automating repeatable work and documenting the rest</li>
        <li>Blameless learning over reactive firefighting</li>
        <li>Systems that empower teams rather than constrain them</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="small">
        The projects on this site are intentionally sanitized and
        production-inspired. They demonstrate architecture, tradeoffs, and
        operational thinking without exposing proprietary systems or data.
