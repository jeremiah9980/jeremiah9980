      <p class="meta">
        A reference project demonstrating how enterprise workloads are assessed,
        migrated, and stabilized in cloud environments with a strong emphasis on
        network design, security boundaries, and operational continuity.
      </p>

      <hr class="sep"/>

      <!-- OVERVIEW -->
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        This project models a phased cloud migration approach where networking is treated
        as a first-class reliability and security concern. Rather than focusing on tooling,
        the emphasis is placed on sequencing, dependency awareness, blast-radius control,
        and post-migration operability.
      </p>
      <p>
        All examples are intentionally sanitized and represent production-inspired
        decision-making patterns used in large enterprise environments.
      </p>

      <!-- PROBLEM -->
      <h3>Problem Space</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Legacy on-prem workloads with undocumented dependencies</li>
        <li>Mixed trust zones and flat network topologies</li>
        <li>Need for hybrid connectivity during transition</li>
        <li>High risk of outage during large-scale migration events</li>
        <li>Operational teams needing continuity throughout the process</li>
      </ul>

      <hr class="sep"/>

      <!-- APPROACH -->
      <h3>Architecture & Migration Approach</h3>
      <p>
        Migration is approached as a controlled program rather than a single event.
        Network architecture is established early to ensure that workloads can move
        incrementally without expanding blast radius or weakening security posture.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Hub-and-spoke network topology</li>
        <li>Explicit segmentation by trust zone and workload type</li>
        <li>Hybrid connectivity (VPN / private link) during transition</li>
        <li>Ingress and egress controls defined before workload movement</li>
        <li>Identity and routing validated prior to application cutover</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="card" style="margin-top:1.2rem">
        <strong>Key Principle:</strong>
        <p class="meta">
          Migrate capabilities, not just servers. Networking, identity, and security
          must be operational before application traffic is introduced.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- PHASES -->
      <h3>Migration Phases</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Discovery & Dependency Mapping</strong> – Understand traffic flows and coupling</li>
        <li><strong>Network & Identity Baseline</strong> – Establish secure connectivity and segmentation</li>
        <li><strong>Pilot Workloads</strong> – Validate assumptions with low-risk services</li>
        <li><strong>Incremental Scale-Out</strong> – Migrate in controlled waves</li>
        <li><strong>Optimization & Steady State</strong> – Cost, performance, and reliability tuning</li>
      </ol>

      <hr class="sep"/>

      <!-- OPERATIONS -->
      <h3>Operational Considerations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Monitoring and alerting validated before production cutover</li>
        <li>Rollback paths defined for every migration phase</li>
        <li>Change windows aligned with business risk tolerance</li>
        <li>Runbooks updated as topology evolves</li>
      </ul>

      <hr class="sep"/>

      <!-- OUTCOMES -->
      <h3>Outcomes & Lessons Learned</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced outage risk through phased execution</li>
        <li>Improved security posture via explicit segmentation</li>
        <li>Faster troubleshooting due to cleaner network boundaries</li>
        <li>Smoother handoff to operations teams post-migration</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The primary lesson reinforced by this work is that cloud migration success is
        determined less by tooling and more by sequencing, communication, and operational
        discipline.
